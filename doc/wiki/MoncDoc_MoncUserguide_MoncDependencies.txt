= MONC dependencies =
[[PageOutline]]

As well as connecting to mosrs, to build and run MONC, there are the following dependencies and libraries that need to be available
   * FCM
   * subversion - SVN
   * netcdf-parallel
   * hdf5 
   * fftw
   * mpich

Below are instructions on how to install or make these dependencies available on the systems that MONC has been tested on

=== MONC dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04 ===
   * FCM - For instructions about installing FCM go to http://metomi.github.io/fcm/doc/installation/ but all you need to to is
      * Download the tar.gz from Github, unpack and then add location of fcm/bin to your path
   * SVN - install through synaptic package manager on ubuntu, search for subversion, mark subversion, accept dependencies and apply or use the follwoing command line

{{{
sudo apt-get install subversion 
}}}

To install all other dependencies use the install-monc-extras script, which can be obtain with the following command
{{{
fcm co https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/monc/scripts/trunk/metomi_vms_install_monc_extras
}}}
The script location should be added to your path or moved to /usr/local/bin (which is in your path) and can then be run 
{{{
sudo install-monc-extras
}}}

=== MONC dependencies on metomi-vms ===
The metomi-vms (see [https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/monc/wiki/MoncDoc/MoncUserguide/MoncVms Moncmetomi-vms]) already has FCM and SVN and deals with the password caching. All you have to do with this is run the install-monc-extras.

To install all other dependencies use the install-monc-extras script, which can be obtain with the following command
{{{
fcm co https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/monc/scripts/trunk/metomi_vms_install_monc_extras
}}}
The script location should be added to your path or moved to /usr/local/bin (which is in your path), i.e.

{{{
sudo cp install-monc-extras /usr/local/bin/.
}}}

Then run the install script with the following
{{{
sudo install-monc-extras
}}}
This install will take around 20 minutes to complete.

=== MONC depencies on Met Office linux desktops ===
To install the appropriate libraries on the Met Office desktops, simply run the following commands to set up the environment:

{{{
source /data/users/lfric/modules/setup
module load environment/monc/gnu/5.3.0
}}}
